# STAT 545B: Assignment B3

This assignment focuses on working with "Shiny" applications. Selecting, **option A: BC Liquor app**, I decided to modify an existing app.

### Description
This app provides basic data exploration and analysis for the BC Liquor dataset. The user can filter the dataset using custom selection on price range and drink type(s). The app also displays the filtered dataset. To enhance the value provided to the user the app increases data exploration functionality and user experience through the addition of following three features:  
  
- **Displaying an image**  
  Including relevant image(s) enhances the visual appeal thereby increasing user interface experience.  
- **Computing results for user filters**  
  Total product items based on the combination of user filters is calculated and displayed - directly increasing the data analysis functionality by returning a concise answer to a query over a large dataset.  
- **Improving information and layout**  
  Plot for another data attribute is added; allow multi-dimension data exploration, and is displayed via 'tabs' layout for an aesthetic and appropriate representation scheme i.e. related information is placed closely.

### App Access
